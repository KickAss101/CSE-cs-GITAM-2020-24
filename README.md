## CSE Specialization in cybersecurity in GITAM, Vizag (20-24 batch)

Self made notes by scraping information from the internet and already available materials given by the faculty which are
mostly outdated (corresponding to the curriculum) or inadequate or sometimes hideous :|

__Few of the things these notes offer:__
- Very keen notes to the circulumn
- Resource links (videos & blogs) to the concepts that I personally used to understand the concepts
- Backlinks to the concepts that repeat across subjects, so that you've a overview of what's linked to what
- Images

__My recommendation of how you should use this:__
- Clone/Download this repo(notes) and open it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- You can also use any other note taking app but you might not get backlinks support

ðŸ”´ __Note:__ 
- I started note taking only from SEM IV
- The notes are not completely scraped from somewhere but made with some interpretation
- These are only meant for learning but not for scoring; they do have difference

## Tips to learn/study smart

> These require some discipline - I'm not gonna lie, I've very little :D

### Advanced Information Processing Technique
- Ask more questions when learning to memorize better and to distinguish between recognition and understanding

> Now, the Feynman Technique is time consuming. So, it's not a good idea to follow as it is when a semester is nearing, you can skip the part of writing on a paper.
> But it'll help you ensure that you know what you just learned like if you're studying for a supply

### The Feynman Technique
- Choose a concept; read and understand.
- Explain the concept to a person or yourself and write it down on a piece of paper using simple language as possible.
- Pinpoint any complicated terms and simply them as elementary level as possible.
- Identify problem areas and go back to the source to review and fill those gaps.
- Repeat the process until you fully comprehend

### Optimal learning habits
- Manage energy (Know when you're more focused in a day and use that time to study)
- Choose modules carefully (Focus on important, interesting topics first)
- 60 sec rule (Write summary of what you just learned in a lecture, maybe not practical) 
- Set goals (like a module/subject in a week or 5 days)
