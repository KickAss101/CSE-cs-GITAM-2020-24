### Peripheral Devices
A **peripheral** is a device that is used to put information into or get information out of the computer.

There are three different types of peripherals:
- Input devices
- Output devices
- Input/Output devices

__Input Devices:__ An input device is a term for a physical piece of hardware that connects to a primary device, such as a computer, in order to provide user input.
__Output Devices:__ An output device is any hardware device used to send data from a computer to another device or user.
__Input/Output Devices:__ An input/output device is a hardware device that has the ability to accept inputted, outputted or other processed data. It also can acquire respective media data as input sent to a computer or send computer data to storage media as storage output.
