### Associative Memories
- An associative memory can be considered as a memory unit whose stored data can be identified for access by the content of the data itself rather than by an address or memory location. This type of search _helps in reducing the search time by a large extent_.
- It is also known as _Content Addressable Memory(CAM)_.

__Working of Associative Memory__  
- Data is _stored at the very first empty location_ found in memory.  
- When data is stored at a particular location then _no address is stored_ along with it.  
- When the _stored data need to be searched then only the key (i.e. data or part of data) is provided_.
- A _sequential search is performed in the memory_ using the specified key to find out the matching key from the memory.
- If the _data content is found then it is marked for reading_ by the memory.

- An associative memory consists of a _memory array and logic for 'm' words with 'n' bits per word_.
- The functional registers like the argument register **A** and key register **K** each have **n** bits, one for each bit of a word. The match register **M** consists of **m** bits, one for each memory word.
- The words which are kept in the memory are compared in parallel with the content of the argument register.

__Associative memory organization__
- memory array
- logic for m words with n bits per word
- Several registers like input register, mask register, select register and output register.

__Argument Register (A):__ It contains the word to be searched
__Key Register (K):__ It specifies which part of the argument needs to be compared with words in the memory.
- If all bits are set '1' then entire word needs to compared else only the bits having '1' will be compared.
__Associative Memory Array:__ It contains the words which are to be compared with the argument word. 
__Match Register (M):__ After matching process, the bits corresponding to matching words are set '1' in match register.
__Input Register:__ It holds data that is to be written into associative memory.
__Output Register (Y):__ It contains the matched data word that is retrieved from associative memory

__Advantages__
- Associative memory searching process is fast.  
- Associative memory is suitable for parallel searches.

__Disadvantages__
- Associative memory is expensive than RAM

### Memory Management Hardware
[[OS 4#Memory Management]]
- A memory management system is a _collection of hardware and software procedures for managing the various programs residing in memory_.
- The memory management software is _part of an operating system_ available in many computers. Here we are concerned with the hardware unit associated with the memory management system

__Basic Components of Memory Management Unit__
- __Dynamic address relocation:__ Facility for dynamic storage relocation that map logical memory to physical memory addresses
- __Sharing Common Programs:__ Provision for sharing common programs stored in memory by different users
- __Protection:__ Protection of information against unauthorized access and preventing users from changing OS functions.

#### Dynamic Address Relocation
- The dynamic storage relocation hardware is a _mapping process_ similar to the paging system.
- The fixed page size used in the virtual memory system causes certain difficulties with respect to _program size and the logical structure of programs_.
- It is more convenient to divide programs and data into logical parts called segments.
- A __segment__ is a _set of logically related instructions or data elements associated with a given name_. Segments may be _generated by the programmer or by the operating system_.
- Examples of segments are a subroutine, an array of data, a table of symbols, or a user's program.

#### Sharing of Common Programs
- It is an integral part of _multiprogramming_.
- Other system programs residing in memory are also shared by all users in a multiprogramming system _without having to produce multiple copies_.
- The other issue in multiprogramming is _protecting one program from unwanted interaction with another_. An example of unwanted interaction is one user's unauthorized copying of another user's program.
- Another aspect of protection is concerned with _preventing the occasional user from performing operating system functions_ and thereby interrupting the orderly sequence of operations in a computer installation.

#### Memory Protection
- Memory protection can be assigned to the physical address or the logical address.
- The protection of memory through the physical address can be done by _assigning a number of protection bits for each block in memory_ that indicate the _type of access allowed to its corresponding block_.
