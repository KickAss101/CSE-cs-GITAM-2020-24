### The Link Layer
- The data link layer of the OSI model prepares network data for the physical network. The data link layer is _responsible for network interface card (NIC) to network interface card communications_. 
- __The data link layer does the following:__
	-   _Enables upper layers to access the media_. The upper layer protocol is completely unaware of the type of media that is used to forward the data.
	-   _Accepts data_, usually Layer 3 packets (i.e., IPv4 or IPv6), and _encapsulates them into Layer 2 frames_.
	-   _Controls how data is placed and received on the media._
	-   _Exchanges frames between endpoints_ over the network media.
	-   _Receives encapsulated data_, usually Layer 3 packets, and _directs them to the proper upper-layer protocol_.
	-   Performs _error detection and rejects any corrupt frame_.
