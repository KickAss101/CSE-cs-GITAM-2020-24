### Cryptographic Hash Function
__Cryptographic Hash Function:__ 
- A hash function is a _mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size to a fixed length output_ in a deterministic and random manner.
- A hash function H _accepts a variable-length block of data M as input_ and produces a fixed-size hash value h = H(M)
- The values returned by the hash function are called _hash values, hash codes, digests, simply hashes_ 

__Features of Hash Functions__
- Hash function coverts data of arbitrary length to a fixed length. This process is often referred to as **hashing the data**.
-  In general, the _hash is much smaller than the input data_, hence hash functions are sometimes called **compression functions**.
-  Since a hash is a _smaller representation of a larger data_, it is also referred to as a **digest**.
-  Hash function with n bit output is referred to as an **n-bit hash function**. Popular hash functions generate values between 160 and 512 bits.
