### Principles of Public-Key Cryptosystems

---
### The RSA Algorithm

---
### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm
- Not an encryption algorithm
- Exchange secret/_symmetric key_
- Asymmetric encryption: public & private keys are used

__Algorithm__
- Assume prime number __q__
- Select **α** such that α is _primitive root of q and α < q_
- Assume X(a) (Private Key), X(a) < q
- Calculate Y(a) (Public Key), Y(a) = α ^(X(a)) mod q
- Calculate Y(b)
