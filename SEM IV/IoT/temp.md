## Communication in the IoT
- Internet Principles
- __Internet Communications__ 
	- An Overview, IP, TCP, The IP Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), UDP, IP Addresses, DNS, Static IP Address Assignment, Dynamic IP Address Assignment, IPv6, MAC Addresses, TCP and UDP Ports
- __An Example:__ HTTP Ports, Other Common Ports
- __Application Layer Protocols__
	- HTTP
	- HTTPS: Encrypted HTTP
	- Other Application Layer Protocols.  

__Learning Outcomes__
• interpret different protocols and compare them
• select which protocol can be used for a specific application
• utilize the Internet communication protocols for IoT applications

- TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol
- It is a _reliable and connection-oriented_ transport protocol
- With TCP, data can be delivered successfully and accurately
- Many application such as web, email and FTP use TCP
- Before TCP transmit data, it'll use _three-way handshake_ to establish a connection
-  __Three-way Handshake:__
	- Client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to server
	- If the server is up, it replies with SYN-ACK packet which means synchronization is acknowledged and asks for the client to open a connection
	-  The client replies with ACK (acknowledgement) with a connection open
	- Then the two way connection is established
