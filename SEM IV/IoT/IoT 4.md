### IoT with Cloud - Challenges

---
### IoT Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is the _delivery of computing services over the internet_, by providing flexible, affordable, effective and efficient resources for development.
- That includes _servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence_.
- Cloud computing provide _economical freedom along with technical strength to the application_.
- In other word, it is about _outsourcing of IT services and infrastructure to make them available anywhere via the Internet_.

#### Types of Cloud Computing
__Public__
- 
__Private__

### Types of Cloud service Providers
__Infrastructure as a Service__
- With _IaaS_, a provider supplies the basic compute, storage and networking infrastructure along with the hypervisor -- the virtualization layer.
- Users must then _create virtual instances such as VMs and containers, install OSes, support applications and data, and handle all of the configuration and management associated with those tasks_.
- Some examples of IaaS services are DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure, Google

__Platform as a Service__
- With _PaaS_, a provider offers more of the application stack than IaaS, adding OSes, middleware, such as databases, and other runtimes into the cloud environment.
- PaaS products include Google App Engine, Heroku

__Software as a Service__
- With _SaaS_, a provider offers an _entire application stack_. Users simply log in and use the application that runs completely on the provider's infrastructure.
- Typically, SaaS applications are completely accessible via internet web browser. SaaS providers manage the application workload and all underlying IT resources; users only control the data created by the SaaS application.
- Examples of SaaS include Salesforce, Dropbox and Google Workspace, Netflix, Zoom.

__Advantages__
- Cost: Cloud computing eliminates the _cost of purchasing hardware and software, setting up and infrastructure management.
- Speed of setting up a cloud service: Cloud computing services are provided as self service and on demand. Vast amounts of computing resources can be provided in a few minutes with a few mouse clicks.
- Security:  
- Reliability: Cloud computing has data backup, disaster recovery.
- Scalability: Ability  to scale up and flexibility. It means increasing and decreasing IT resources are easy on cloud computing. Like power, storage, bandwidth etc
-  

__Disadvantages__
