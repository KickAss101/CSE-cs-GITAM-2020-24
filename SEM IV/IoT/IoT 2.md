### Embedded Computing Basics
[TechTarget - Blog](https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/embedded-system)
__Embedded System:__ It is a combination of a computer hardware and software designed for a specific function within a larger mechanical or electrical system.
__Ex:__ Automobiles, Mobile Phones, Industrial Machines, Medical Equipment.

__How does an embedded system work?__
- They comprise a _processor, power supply, and memory and communication ports_. 
- Embedded systems use the _communication ports to transmit data between the processor and peripheral devices_ - often, other embedded systems - _using a communication protocol_.
- The processor _interprets this data with the help of software stored on the memory_. The software is usually highly specific to the function that the embedded system serves.
- The processor may be a microprocessor or microcontroller.
