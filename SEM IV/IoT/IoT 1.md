###  Introduction and Definition of Internet of Things
__The Internet of Things__ describes physical objects with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks
- “IoT refers to the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data”

### IoT Growth & Application Areas of IoT
#### Growth of IoT
- Overall enterprise Internet of Things (IoT) spending grew 22.4% in 2021 to $158 billion.
- Key macro tailwinds for the IoT market size going forward include maturing technologies such as AI, 5G, and cloud as well as the role that IoT plays in reaching sustainability goals.
- Key macro headwinds include rising input prices, intensified skill/labor shortages, and the ongoing chip shortage

#### Application areas in IoT
- Smart Homes
- Wearable’s
- Smart Cars
- Industries
- Smart Cities
- IoT in Agriculture
- Healthcare
- Power Engagement

### Characteristics of IoT
- __Connectivity:__ Things in iot should be connected to the infrastructure and connectivity is an important character/requirement for an iot infra. Anyone, anywhere, anytime – connectivity should be guaranteed in the iot infra. Without connection, nothing makes sense! (I say that, things are connected and they need connectivity)
- __Intelligence and identity:__ The extraction of knowledge (i.e. what is to be inferenced) from the generated data is very important. Sensors generate data, the data is to be interpreted properly!  Each iot device has an unique identity (remember IP address). This identity is helpful in tracking the equipment and at times to query the status.
- __Scalability:__ the number of things (devices) getting connected to iot infra is getting increased day by day. Hence, an iot setup shall be capable to handle the massive expansion. Also, the data generated shall be massive and it should be handled appropriately.
- __Dynamic and self adapting (complexity):__ the iot devices should dynamically adapt itself to the changing contexts. Assume a camera meant for surveillance. It may have to work in different conditions as different light situations (morning, afternoon, night) 
- __Architecture:__ architecture cannot be homogeneous in nature. It should be hybrid, supporting different manufacturer's product to be in the iot network.
- __SAFETY:__ Having got all the things connected to internet, the personal data (if sensitive) is under threat. Hence, securing the data is a major challenge . Not only data security, the equipment getting involved in IoT network is huge. Hence, persona safety is also to be considered. PRIVACY with PROTECTION!

### Things in IoT
- Things refer to variety of devices. Not really just one device become things.
- At times, you and I are things! (Think, How)
- Anything to qualify as a “THING” require identity.
- The “thing” can monitor/measure etc. means, a temperature sensor could be a thing!
- Things are capable of exchanging data (could be sharing) with other connected devices in the infra.
- The data could be stored in a centralized server (cloud computing), processed there and a control action could be initiated. The devices involved In getting this accomplished are things!!!!
- Some of the famous things which you are aware of:
	- Temperature sensors
	- Pressure sensors
	- Humidity sensors etc.
- The data from above sensors are collected (real time) and sent to the cloud. (sometimes, it could be a local server)
- Based on the data analysis, the control action would be taken.
- Example: switching off the water heater remotely, when the water is heated as per requirement. 
- Not just sensors, the following also can be called as things (see RHS).
- Industrial motors
- Wearables (your watch, band)
- Vehicles
- Shoes
