### Propositional Logic 
- Propositional logic is a _technique of knowledge representation in logical and mathematical form where all the statements are made by propositions_.  
- Proposition is a _declarative statement which is either true or false_ but cannot be both.
- Propositional logic is also called _Boolean logic_ as it works on 0 and 1
- The phrase propositional logic is composed of two words:
	- Proposition
		- 
	- Logic
		- Logic is science of reasoning
		- With rules of logic, we can think in mathematical statements and prove or disprove those mathematical statements

- A proposition formula which is _always true_ is called _tautology_, and it is also called a valid  sentence.
- A proposition formula which is always false is called _Contradiction_.

__Types of propositions__
- Atomic Proposition (Simple)
	- Consists of a _single  proposition symbol_.
- Compound proposition
	- Consists of _atomic propositions, using parenthesis and logical connectives_.
