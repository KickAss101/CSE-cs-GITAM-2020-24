### First-Order Logic
#### Representation Revisited
- __First-order logic__ is another way of _knowledge representation in artificial  
intelligence_. It is an extension to propositional logic.
- FOL is sufficiently expressive to represent the natural language statements in  
a concise way.  
- First-order logic is also known as Predicate logic or First-order predicate  
logic.  
- First-order logic is a powerful language that _develops information about the  
objects_ in a more easy way and can also express the relationship between  
those objects.
- First-order logic (like natural language) does not only assume that the world  
contains facts like propositional logic but also assumes the following things  
in the world:  
- __Objects__: A, B, people, numbers, colors, wars, theories, squares, pits,  
wumpus, etc
- __Relations:__ It can be unary relation such as: red, round, is adjacent, or n-any  
relation such as: the sister of, brother of, has color, comes between  
- __Function:__ Father of, best friend, third inning of, end of, etc
- As a natural language, first-order logic also has two main parts:  
	- Syntax  
	- Semantics

#### Syntax and Semantics
The syntax of FOL determines which collection of symbols is a logical  
expression in first-order logic. The basic syntactic elements of first-order  
logic are symbols.  
â–ª We write statements in short-hand notation in FOL.
