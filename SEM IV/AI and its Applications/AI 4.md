### First-Order Logic
- __First-order logic__ is another way of _knowledge representation in artificial  
intelligence_. It is an extension to propositional logic.
- FOL is sufficiently expressive to represent the natural language statements in  
a concise way.  
- First-order logic is also known as Predicate logic or First-order predicate  
logic.  
- First-order logic is a powerful language that develops information about the  
objects in a more easy way and can also express the relationship between  
those objects.
