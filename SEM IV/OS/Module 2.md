>__Process:__ A program in execution
__Thread:__ A thread is the unit of execution within a process. 

#### Process State
[Process State | neso academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ_6PXoaoxo&ab_channel=NesoAcademy)
>- As a process executes, it changes state
>- The state of a process is defined in part by the current activity of that process

- __New:__ The process  is being created
- __Ready:__ The process is waiting to be assinged to a processor
- __Running:__ Instructions are being executed
- __Waiting:__ The process is wiating for some event to occur such as I/O completion or reception of a signal
- __Terminated:__ The process has finished execution
