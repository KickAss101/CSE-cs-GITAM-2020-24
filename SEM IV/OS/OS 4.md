### Memory Management

__Memory management unit__ (MMU) is the physical hardware that maps virtual/logical memory space to the physical memory. The MMU is usually located within the computer’s central processing unit (CPU), but sometimes operates in a separate integrated chip (IC). All data request inputs are sent to the MMU, which in turn determines whether the data needs to be retrieved from RAM or ROM storage.
- The MMU also includes a _section of memory_ that holds a table that matches virtual addresses to physical addresses, called the _translation lookaside buffer_ (TLB).
- User _processes must be restricted_ so that they only access memory locations that belong to that particular process. 
- This is usually implemented using a _base register and a limit register_ for each process.
- A base and a limit register _define a logical address space_
- The base register holds the smallest legal physical memory address and limit register specifies the size of the range.
- Every memory access made by a user process is checked against these two registers, and if a memory access is attempted outside the valid range, then a _fatal error is generated_.

__MMU performs three major functions__
-   Hardware memory management
	- It deals with a system's _RAM and cache memory_
-   Operating system (OS) memory management
	- It regulates _resources_ among objects and data structures
-   Application memory management
	- It _allocates and optimizes_ memory among programs.

#### Logical v/s Physical Address Space

__Logical Address Space__
It is a virtual address generated by the CPU is known as “Logical Address”. Logical address space can be defined as the size of the process. 
- This address is _used as a reference to access the physical memory location_ by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a program’s perspective.

__Physical Address Space__
An address seen by the memory unit (i.e., the one loaded into the memory address register of the memory) is commonly known as a “Physical Address”.
- The _set of all physical addresses corresponding to these logical addresses_ is known as Physical address space
- A physical address is computed by MMU. The _run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses_ is done by Memory Management Unit(MMU). The physical address always remains constant.
