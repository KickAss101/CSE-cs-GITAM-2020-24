# 4n + 3, 4n + 1 [Euclid]
# an + b, where a & b don't have common factors [Dirichlet's Theorem]
# 10n + 9, primes ending with 9
# 2^n - 1 (Not for all cases) [Mersenne]
# Find the primes of a given number
# Find the adjacent primes of a given number
# Perfect Numbers, a number N is perfect if it's sum of all it's proper factors (6=1*2*3) [Greeks]
# Even perfect prime number, if 2^n -1 is prime, then N=2^n-1(2^n - 1) is perfect [Euclid]
# 2^N + 1, where N is 2^n [Fermat]
# Polygon sides, One can draw a regular polygon with n sides if and only 
# if n is a power of 2 * unequal Fermat primes. [Gauss]
# Perfect squares, adding first few odd numbers always gives a perfect square
